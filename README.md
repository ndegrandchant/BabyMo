# BabyMoProject

The code for my Baby Monitor Project will be included in this repository.

For this project, I used Arduino IDE and an Arduino motherboard, as well as a DHT 22, Liquid Crystal Display with an I2C backpack, PIR Motion Sensor, RGB Module, Pulse sensor, and a buzzer.

Its functions are the following.

Provide light Feedback information to the 'parents' room Red = fever, temperature above 37 degrees Blue = motion, the baby is awake
Display the Fever and Pulse in the LCD screen
Sound a buzzer when a fever is detected
